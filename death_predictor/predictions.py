        you smell something, you ask your friend, dont you smell something\
        strange?, so you get up and check that old gas oven, crap! gas!\
        you think, you close the valve while your friend comes into the kitchen,\
        asking, What's Up?, when you turn to tell him, your face reflect the\
        fear after seeing your friend igniting a cigarette, all the scene feels\
        like slow motion, your scream gets drown on the explosion sound ",\

        1: "Is June 24th 2045, You have been charged with murder on first degree, you killed a\
        shopkeeper and a client with cold blood and now you are convicted and\
        sentenced to death. Yes, it's true, it wasn't you, but you were in the\
        wrong place at the wrong time, at the moment of your execution, only you\
        believe in your innocence.",\

        2: "Is July 12th 2034, You're going to work, you're tired, you don't feel like anything, really.\
        You try to concentrate on the day ahead, and the things you will have to do,\
        but the bed is fresh in your head, and you imagine yourself comfortably sleeping.\
        It's not fair, you shouldn't have to go to work today. So you think,\
        I hope something happens, and I don't have to go to work, you know, just for a second.\
        And after that brief second, your wish comes true. The sky, the clouds, which until now\
        were grey, are now.... red. They don't have the color they get at sunset.\
        It's fire red? orange? yellow? It's fire. Fire in the sky....\
        One second, and you think it's a meteorite, it's a damn meteorite that's gonna\
        hit the ground. Two seconds. No way. That only happens in the movies.\
        Three seconds and you see it, it's not just like in the movies, it's a meteorite,\
        huge, you can't, you can't calculate where it will fall, but it's close. Very close. \
        He's here. Four seconds and you're dead.",\

        3: "Is September 22nd 2054, You get out of the car with your partner.\
        It was hard to find a parking space,\
        but you did it. The afternoon is pleasant, a perfect temperature for a walk,\
        a Friday afternoon. You breathe deeply, with a smile on your face.\
        Then it happens. An explosion? No, a bolt of lightning, a bolt of lightning\
        has struck a nearby tree, splitting it in half. Suddenly, the harmless clouds\
        do not seem so harmless, they are dark and black. And threatening. Another beam.\
        Two others. The white of the lightning contrasts with the darkness of the clouds.\
        The thunder is all around you, it's a thunderstorm like none you've ever seen before.\
        The buildings take most of it, but some of it gets to the ground. Another beam strikes\
        a traffic light, taking it apart and throwing it against a car. You cover your ears,\
        the thunder is deafening. You run, but you don't know where. You just watched\
        lightning strike someone in the distance. You're stuck in place, trying to react,\
        the body doesn't move. You instinctively run for cover by sticking to the wall of\
        a building. You're not sure if your shelter is the safest, but you've seen that it's\
        better than staying in the middle of the street. You notice a chill on the back\
        of your neck. The wall is very cold, you touch it with your hand on your back,\
        and you feel the touch. You quickly turn around, and you realize you're clinging\
        to a gutter. a Metallic gutter. You hear one more thunder, the last one,\
        over your head. You don't have time to look up or let go of the gutter,\
        the lightning gets into your body, and the last thing you see is all white.",\

        4: "Is November 15, 2071, It's an hour before he gets here, and you've got three stoves burning.\
        Your favorite dish, you'll see what your partner's face looks like when he\
        comes home and sees what you've prepared for him. You move quickly through\
        the kitchen gadgets, the oil sizzles in a frying pan, the heat begins to\
        overwhelm you. But you know it's worth the effort, you may not even finish\
        your dinner, and you will be already on dessert. You leave the oil in the frying pan\
        for a while, think about your things and watch as it begins to heat up.\
        That's when the phone rings. You can barely hear it with the sound of the\
        extractor hood. You come out of the kitchen, you answer the phone.\
        Is your boss. You don't want to talk to him and start getting overwhelmed\
        by questions, while you just think it's not work time, that you shouldn't\
        put up with this thing. You go to your room in search of some information,\
        to check some dates, you close the door of the kitchen while you are going to,\
        the noise of the extractor hood is very loud, and you can barely hear your\
        boss, despite what he is shouting. You pick up the papers, and start arguing\
        about dates, one doesn't fit, the one your boss has is not the same as the one\
        you have, and about that date, about that stupid date, you keep arguing and yelling\
        God knows how long. After a while you realize that you've left the pan with oil in it,\
        and you don't know how long it's been like this. You say something to your boss, and\
        you run to the kitchen, opening the door. The flare is so fast, it doesn't even hurt.\
        The combustion you have caused by opening the door, and feeding the small fire in your\
        kitchen knocks you down, and it begins to spread. Your body doesn't hurt, or it hurts\
        too much, you're not sure. You don't see anything, you just hear the crackle of fire\
        around you, and the phone, where your boss yells at you. Are you still there? Answer\
        the damn phone! You must fix those dates for me, or you're fired, you hear me?\
        You're fired! You're fired! It doesn't matter. You're dead",\

        5: "Is May 17, 2053. Hands in your pockets, it's a particularly cold night\
        and your hands are a little numb. You keep walking, on your way to your new home.\
        You call it new, but you've been living in it for a while now. Enough to make\
        the road you're on, a routine. So you believe you're not in for any surprises.\
        You hear 'Hey you! Asshole!' so you look behind you. A small group is approaching.\
        One carries a bat, others carry more items that do not bode well. You don't think\
        about it and run in the opposite direction, while they start chasing you.\
        They have no reason to come after me. Why are they after me? you think while\
        you're running. You keep running, but soon one of them catches up with you and\
        takes you down. Once on the ground the blows start to fall from too many places.\
        The first thing you notice is your septum breaking. Five more punches and you lose\
        consciousness. After a few minutes, that to you make hours, some figures surround you,\
        you do not distinguish them, but you see dazzling lights. They move you, carefully,\
        and take you to a place you can't see because of the blinding light on your face.\
        Everything moves very slowly. Everything is white. Finally everything turns black.\
        You're dead.",\

        6: "Is December 13, 2034. You laugh for yourself, out loud. You still remember\
        some nonsense your friends said tonight. It's nighttime, you notice the tiredness\
        in your body, you notice a small trace of alcohol in your blood, enough to laugh\
        again. You notice your bed close by, you can't wait to get into it... A figure is\
        walking on the same sidewalk as you. There is something in his walk that does not\
        inspire confidence, seems to be heading towards you and does not look good. You\
        change sidewalks,'it's the safest thing to do' you think. You get a chill when you\
        see the guy change his approach, and he crosses you and gets in your way. You try\
        to surround him, but he gets in the way again. 'your money' mutters. For a second\
        hesitation and babbling, and before you have time to say something coherent,\
        he repeats, in a louder tone, 'Give me your money! The scream scares you and\
        you run scared to death. The guy grabs your arm, and when you turn to get out\
        of it you see a terrifying glow in his other hand, which he stabs you with,\
        first in the chest, then in the abdomen. You fall to the ground, writhing in pain,\
        and you're still surprised at the decision the guy makes to take your wallet out of\
        your bloody pockets and run. You're dying. You're really dying, and you know it.\
        The dumbest death, it could have been someone else, it could have been another time,\
        another place. But no. It's your turn. It's your turn. He touched you, and you die.\
        No matter who comes to help you, you know it's too late, there's no one to do anything\
        for you. You'll die.",\

        7: "Is August 20, 2027. You're going to work, you're tired, you don't feel like\
        anything, really. You try to concentrate on the day ahead, and the things you\
        will have to do, but the bed is fresh in your head, and you imagine yourself\
        comfortably sleeping. It's not fair, you shouldn't have to go to work today.\
        I hope something happens, and I don't have to go to work, you know, for a second.\
        And after that brief second, your wish comes true. An explosion? No, a bolt of\
        lightning, a bolt of lightning has struck a nearby tree, splitting it in half.\
        Suddenly, the harmless clouds do not seem so harmless, they are dark and black.\
        And threatening. It's raining. Slightly at first, stronger afterwards. In a matter\
        of seconds it's a waterfall over the streets, which makes you soaked. In a matter\
        of minutes the street turns into a river, which reaches you by your ankles. You go\
        running home, walking as you can, the water keeps rising, as it pours over you.\
        It's the damn universal flood, you think. Before you reach the end of the street,\
        the water comes down your knees, you lean on the walls so that the current doesn't\
        carry you, but it's very strong and ends up knocking you down. You slide several\
        feet until you hold onto a car. You see an old lady being dragged by the current\
        near you, you don't catch her, you don't try. You're too busy trying not to get\
        carried away by the current. You try to get in the car from behind, and when\
        you get to the roof, you feel a terrible pain in your legs. Another car has\
        been dragged downstream and crashed into yours, trapping you. The pain is\
        unbearable, but the worst part is the anguish of not being able to escape,\
        while the water level rises and rises... After several minutes, you have to\
        work hard to stick your head out and get some air. Every puff costs you more,\
        every puff you have to stretch further. The last puff, it's just water and mud.",\

        8: "Is February 1, 2022. You're in the hospital bed, you've been there for weeks.\
        Luckily or unfortunately, you know you don't have much time left in there.\
        You don't have long to live, you're going to die.... It's lupus. No doctor\
        was able to detect it in time because of your erratic seizures. The irony is\
        that it's not lupus that's killing you, but a common flu, which has caught you\
        with hardly any defenses, from the medication. You're gonna die of the flu, and\
        it's gonna be soon. You want it all to be over. Why lengthen the inevitable?\
        You want to rest, and you want your friends and family to rest too. You want\
        this agony to end, you've been in that hospital for months, dying of pain,\
        full of medicine, and no chance of getting out of there alive. You know that's\
        the last room you'll see. You're lucky, someone, you don't know if a relative or\
        a friend, but you're sure it's someone who loves you very much, he brought\
        you some chocolates. The luck isn't the chocolates, they can't cheer you up,\
        the luck comes in. One of the chocolates they give you is carrying something,\
        you don't know what, but you don't care. What interests you is that it's your\
        ticket out, the end of your agony. You wonder which of your acquaintances\
        may have put poison in, but you'd rather spend your last few seconds to thank him.",\

        9: "Is January 15, 2034. Alright, this is the fifth time you've called the stewardess,\
        and this is the fifth time she's ignored you. That's what's missing, not only do you\
        find yourself on a flight you didn't want to ride, but the service is terrible too.\
        You'll never, ever travel on low cost again. At least there's not much left of a trip...\
        The plane is flying too low, really low. And it's too early to be at the airport.\
        You look out the window, it's too low, and you can't see the runway anywhere.\
        The driver says something over the loudspeaker, but the roar of the engine and\
        the hasty nature of his words make it hard for you to even know what language he\
        said it in. You look out the window again, one last time. The plane hits the\
        ground head-on. Pieces of metal are twisted by crushing the cabin and the hallway.\
        Your seat is split in two by a piece of fuselage. But you don't care, you were\
        already dead at the time of impact.",\

        10: "Is December 29, 2021. Your pride is hurt. You have to admit, with that shitty car,\
        and the bastard dared to overtake you. The moment you get out of the heavy truck that\
        had you trapped in your lane, you step on the gas pedal and pass a couple of cars in\
        a row. You want to see the look on the guy's face in the black car when you snort\
        past him. Suddenly the silhouette of the old black car crosses your path.\
        It's hard for you to react, and realize that the car is in the middle of the lane\
        you're in. He's had an accident, and you don't have time to react before you join him,\
        too fast. Everything is black. You regain consciousness momentarily. So many parts of\
        your body hurt, you can't tell what the worst part is. You're caught in the\
        ironwork and the last thing you see is a bunch of paramedics watching you, with\
        a worried face. They're not trying to save you. It's no use, it's too late for you.",\

        11: "Is November 14, 2020. It's an hour before he gets here, and you've got three\
        stoves burning. Your favorite dish, you'll see what your partner's face looks like\
        when he comes home and sees what you've prepared for him. You move quickly\
        through the kitchen gadgets, the oil sizzles in a frying pan, the heat begins\
        to overwhelm you. But you know it's worth the effort, you may not even finish\
        your dinner, and you will have the dessert earlier. Argh! That hurt! That hurt!\
        You don't even know how you did it, but you cut your arm. How damn clumsy! And it hurts!\
        The cut doesn't look deep, but... it's a lot of blood, and it's all yours...\
        You run to the phone, you're a little dizzy, and you trip on your way to the phone.\
        You start to get nervous, and you pick up the phone torpidly. What for? It's just a cut,\
        they're not gonna bring an ambulance for a knife cut, that's stupid. You put the\
        dishcloth on your arm, there's too much blood. You run to the door, and you realize\
        that you have not taken keys or anything, you turn on yourself and you slip,\
        falling to the ground, with your own blood. You try to get up, but you're weak.\
        You're back on the phone, the ambulance doesn't seem so exaggerated anymore.\
        There's blood everywhere, your phone slips, you hit something you don't know what\
        it is, the world revolves around you, faster and faster, and darker. The world\
        keeps spinning, but this time without you, you're dead.",\

        12: "Is April 24, 2020. Milk. Milk? No, there is already milk... Mentally you go\
        through the shopping list, as you walk down the street to the supermarket.\
        There's something in the air, you can tell when you come out of your thoughts\
        full of fruit and vegetables. People seem restless... A dog barks at you,\
        scares you, looks scared of something, but you wouldn't know why. You soon find out,\
        suddenly milk matters rather little. You hear an increasingly loud hum, a plane,\
        you look up, instinctively. Between the clouds there is a silhouette. No, three.\
        Three planes, black, two small, one bigger. They surprise you, they're not commercial,\
        and they fly pretty low, making a deafening noise. With a sudden manoeuvre, the two\
        little ones move away from the big one, which is on its way. Even in the distance,\
        you see how the big one drops something. For a moment, your heart is pounding.\
        But you dismiss the idea, it's too stupid, there's no reason to be attacked...\
        The TV said things, but it always exaggerates... A blinding flash wraps everything\
        in white, when you regain your sight, you see a ball of... light? in the distance.\
        An invisible wind shakes you fleetingly. You instinctively hold your hands to your ears,\
        which have been invaded by incredible pain, feel the blood, and realize what has\
        happened. The noise of the explosion blew out your eardrums. If you haven't heard it,\
        it's simply because it made you deaf. Confused, you get up, and you look\
        straight ahead, again. The explosion is sweeping through the nearby buildings,\
        and it's approaching. Fast, really fast. You feel the heat for a second, then the\
        explosion surrounds you and you don't feel anything else...",\

        13: "Is May 6, 2020. Turbulence. You've seen too many movies to be scared.\
        It's nothing but turbulence, nothing to worry about. You see how the old\
        lady next to you is breathing heavily. Looks like she hasn't seen the same\
        movies you have. You're about to calm her down, tell her it's nothing to be\
        scared of, but a big turbulence is shaking the plane, causing a couple of\
        suitcases to fall and let the passengers screaming out. Now you're getting scared.\
        The screams on the right side of the hallway make you look. You don't see it well,\
        but through the windows you seem to see smoke. You move to see it better, effectively,\
        an engine is releasing too much smoke. You even start to see some flames. You try to\
        calm down, you've heard more than once that planes can fly without an engine,\
        you cling to that thought. A shocking crunch scares you, suddenly you see it and\
        wonder if it can fly without a wing? The plane starts to spin and hits you against\
        the seat. You don't know because everything happens too fast, but the plane explodes\
        when it hits the ground. The last images you see are the flames consuming the plane\
        with everyone inside. There are no survivors and you are no exception, you are just\
        another black plastic bag, with a body that will take some time to recognize.",\

        14: "Is December 25, 2020. The afternoon is boring, you don't have much to do.\
        There's nothing on TV, and you don't have a series to watch. You don't feel\
        like going out at all, so you go into the kitchen, make some dinner,\
        kill some time. Something smells bad. You should have checked the expiration\
        dates better. You start sniffing the kitchen, looking for where the smell comes from.\
        It's not from the frying pan, it's not from the food, it's from the sink.\
        How long have those things been there? It's coming from underneath. The garbage?\
        Didn't you take it out today? No. No. It's gas. You know it the moment you\
        open the closet, and a vapor of strong gas smell shakes you up. You throw yourself\
        on the key, but it's already locked. It's some kind of escape, but you don't see it.\
        You get up quickly, and you don't know whether to turn off all the lights, or open\
        a window. You're not sure how to react. But it doesn't matter, your friend,\
        the frying pan, has decided for you, and the oil has burned, releasing a small flame.\
        Boom.",\

        15: "Is August 24, 2045. The journey is going from bad to worse. You thought Congo\
        could be an entertaining destination, but for the moment all you've done is spend money.\
        And the hostel you're staying at, sucks. In the brochure it looked nice, with a pool...\
        but the sad reality is that the pool is a smelly pool, you wouldn't be surprised to\
        see a corpse floating in it. You go into your room, and try to fall asleep in your\
        uncomfortable bed... You get up in your bed dizzy, do you have a fever? Yeah, a\
        little bit. You stand over yourself, and a dizzy spell forces you to lie down again.\
        Perfect, you must have caught a flu or something in the middle of a trip. And it\
        looks like a big deal, your head's spinning. You call the front desk, they\
        send someone over right away. He sees you, tells you to lie down on the bed,\
        and uses the phone to talk to someone, but you don't understand what they say.\
        The fever continues to rise, after an hour you can barely move out of bed,\
        and your whole body burns. A doctor, you can tell by his briefcase and his clothes,\
        comes into your room, starts examining you. He does some tests, and he asks you\
        questions, using another guy as a translator. You try to answer, as you can,\
        but the fever makes it almost impossible to understand what they're asking.\
        After a few minutes, you see through the fever how the doctor and the other boy talk,\
        you don't understand, but the faces are not good. The boy looks at you with a pity\
        face and says something you don't understand, even though he says it in English.\
        The fever keeps rising, you're delirious, you're sweating, you're writhing in pain.\
        You don't know where you are. You don't know what's wrong with you...\
        Luckily, after a while you rest... You're dead"}
