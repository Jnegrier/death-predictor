        0: "On May 21st 2020, you are going to be at home with a friend,\
        you smell something, you ask your friend, dont you smell something\
        strange?, so you get up and check that old gas oven, crap! gas!\
        you think, you close the valve while your friend comes into the kitchen,\
        asking, What's Up?, when you turn to tell him, your face reflect the\
        fear after seeing your friend igniting a cigarette, all the scene feels\
        like slow motion, your scream gets drown on the explosion sound ",\
        1: "On June 24th 2045, You have been charged with murder on first degree, you killed a\
        shopkeeper and a client with cold blood and now you are convicted and\
        sentenced to death. Yes, it's true, it wasn't you, but you were in the\
        wrong place at the wrong time, at the moment of your execution, only you\
        believe in your innocence.",\
        2: "On July 12th 2034, You're going to work, you're tired, you don't feel like anything, really.\
        You try to concentrate on the day ahead, and the things you will have to do,\
        but the bed is fresh in your head, and you imagine yourself comfortably sleeping.\
        It's not fair, you shouldn't have to go to work today. So you think,\
        I hope something happens, and I don't have to go to work, you know, just for a second.\
        And after that brief second, your wish comes true. The sky, the clouds, which until now\
        were grey, are now.... red. They don't have the color they get at sunset.\
        It's fire red? orange? yellow? It's fire. Fire in the sky....\
        One second, and you think it's a meteorite, it's a damn meteorite that's gonna\
        hit the ground. Two seconds. No way. That only happens in the movies.\
        Three seconds and you see it, it's not just like in the movies, it's a meteorite,\
        huge, you can't, you can't calculate where it will fall, but it's close. Very close. \
        He's here. Four seconds and you're dead.",\
        3: "On September 22nd 2054, You get out of the car with your partner.\
        It was hard to find a parking space,\
        but you did it. The afternoon is pleasant, a perfect temperature for a walk,\
        a Friday afternoon. You breathe deeply, with a smile on your face.\
        Then it happens. An explosion? No, a bolt of lightning, a bolt of lightning\
        has struck a nearby tree, splitting it in half. Suddenly, the harmless clouds\
        do not seem so harmless, they are dark and black. And threatening. Another beam.\
        Two others. The white of the lightning contrasts with the darkness of the clouds.\
        The thunder is all around you, it's a thunderstorm like none you've ever seen before.\
        The buildings take most of it, but some of it gets to the ground. Another beam strikes\
        a traffic light, taking it apart and throwing it against a car. You cover your ears,\
        the thunder is deafening. You run, but you don't know where. You just watched\
        lightning strike someone in the distance. You're stuck in place, trying to react,\
        the body doesn't move. You instinctively run for cover by sticking to the wall of\
        a building. You're not sure if your shelter is the safest, but you've seen that it's\
        better than staying in the middle of the street. You notice a chill on the back\
        of your neck. The wall is very cold, you touch it with your hand on your back,\
        and you feel the touch. You quickly turn around, and you realize you're clinging\
        to a gutter. a Metallic gutter. You hear one more thunder, the last one,\
        over your head. You don't have time to look up or let go of the gutter,\
        the lightning gets into your body, and the last thing you see is all white."}
